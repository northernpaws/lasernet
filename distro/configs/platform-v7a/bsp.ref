    OP-TEE is used as secure monitor on STM32MP13x providing power
    management and clock/reset control support. We don't use it as
    part of a trusted boot setup, so we prefer debuggability over
    reduction of the attack surface.
  present:
    - CFG_DEBUG_INFO
    - CFG_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_TESTS
    - CFG_TEE_CORE_TA_TRACE

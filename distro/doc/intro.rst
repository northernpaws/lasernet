Introduction
============

DistroKit is a Board Support Package (BSP) for the `PTXdist
<http://www.ptxdist.org>`_ build system. It assembles a small (but not
minimalistic) Embedded Linux system with modern components:

- barebox bootloader
- mainline kernel, as patch free as possible
- systemd based init
- NetworkManager for dbus based network configuration

It can be used as a base for further BSP development.

DistroKit supports multiple hardware platforms, see chapter
:ref:`hardware-platforms` for more information about them.


Quick Start
-----------

The next sections below describe briefly how to build the BSP from scratch,
but for more in-depth documentation, refer to the `PTXdist manual
<https://www.ptxdist.org/doc/>`_ (or the later chapters if you're reading this
documentation in the HTML or the PDF version).

If you already have a working environment, you can skip to the section about the
individual :ref:`hardware-platforms` for more information on how to build
images, how to flash an image to a board, or how to get a serial console.

Installing PTXdist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DistroKit is built with PTXdist version |ptxdistVendorVersion|.  In order to
install PTXdist,
`download the tarball <http://www.pengutronix.de/software/ptxdist/download/ptxdist-|ptxdistVendorVersion|.tar.bz2>`_
from the PTXdist Download Area.

Extract the tarball:

::

        $ tar xf ptxdist-|ptxdistVendorVersion|.tar.bz2 && cd ptxdist-|ptxdistVendorVersion|

Go to the extracted directory and run

::

        $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

Installing the Toolchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to build a BSP for a different architecture than your host system,
you need a toolchain.
DistroKit is configured for the OSELAS.Toolchain |oselasTCNVendorVersion|.
Depending on the platform you want to build, different toolchains are necessary –
see the sections about the :ref:`hardware-platforms`.

Pre-built Debian packages of the toolchains are available from Pengutronix,
but you can also build the toolchain from source.
See the `OSELAS.Toolchain homepage <https://www.pengutronix.de/de/software/toolchain.html>`_
for more information.


Contributing
------------

The canonical source repository for DistroKit is at
<https://git.pengutronix.de/cgit/DistroKit/>.

For any questions regarding DistroKit, send a mail to the mailing list at
<distrokit@pengutronix.de>.
Note that posts from non-subscribed addresses will be held for moderation.
We recommend that you subscribe to the list by sending a mail to
<distrokit-request@pengutronix.de> containing "subscribe" in the subject.

The same list should also be used to send patches.
The easiest way to format your patch into the canonical patch format is by
using `git format-patch <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch>`_ on the
DistroKit git repository
(also see its man page for info on using mailers other than *git send-email*).

Mails sent to the DistroKit mailing list are archived on ``lore.distrokit.org``.
Patch series can be fetched with `b4 <https://pypi.org/project/b4/>`_ ::

   git config b4.midmask https://lore.distrokit.org/%s
   git config b4.linkmask https://lore.distrokit.org/%s
   b4 am https://lore.distrokit.org/$messageid # replace with link

DistroKit uses the `Developer’s Certificate of Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>`_::

   By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

   a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the
      right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or
   b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
      knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have
      the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether
      created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license
      (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in
      the file; or
   c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
      certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
   d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public
      and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I
      submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
      redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
      involved.

If you can certify the above, then you just add a line saying::

   Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions)
to the end of your commit message,
or if you use Git, make your commit with ``git commit --signoff``.

Maintenance scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before sending your patch, you should run ``ptxdist lint`` and check its output.
Your patch should not add any new lint errors.

The wrapper script ``scripts/p-all`` runs PTXdist with the supplied arguments on
all existing platforms in DistroKit.

To migrate DistroKit to a new PTXdist version, first update the *ptxconfig* by
calling the new PTXdist version explicitely, then use ``scripts/p-all`` (which
will use the PTXdist version from the updated ptxconfig) to update all
*platformconfigs:*:

   $ ptxdist-2024.08.0 migrate
   $ ./scripts/p-all migrate

Some platforms use config diffs for kernel and/or barebox packages.
When touching their config files, you can use ``ptxdist oldconfig all``
to update the config files and keep them in sync.

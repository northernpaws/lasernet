QEmu
====

The v7a platform is ready to run in qemu, using the versatile express
hardware simulation.

There are two ways to run DistroKit inside qemu:

* With barebox:
  Run ``./configs/platform-v7a/run barebox`` to boot the current image with barebox.
* Without barebox:
  Run ``./configs/platform-v7a/run`` to directly start the kernel without barebox.

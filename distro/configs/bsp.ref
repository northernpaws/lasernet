ptxdist_debug_pci:
  description: |
    In DistroKit, we have platforms with and without PCI.
    For x86_64, we don't want to have lspci, although PCI is available in the
    kernel.

    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig()['ARCH_X86']
      value: False

      value: False
    - value: True

kernel_dtb_partitions:
  description: |
    A fixed-partitions node is needed for qemu on mips and
    for some upstream devicetrees in v7a_noneon.
  variants:
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig()['ARCH_MIPS']
      value: True
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig().options.get('PLATFORM') == "v7a_noneon"
      value: True
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig().options.get('PLATFORM') == "v8a"
      value: True
    - value: False

kernel_initrd:
  description: |
    Initrd support is not needed on most embedded systems.
    For v7a and v8a, we use an initrd for the fastboot usecase.
  variants:
    - condition: kconfig.PTXPlatformConfig().options['PLATFORM'] in ('v8a', 'v7a')
      value: True
    - value: False

barebox_arm_optimized_string_functions:
  description: |
    The use of assembler optimized memcpy / memset functions improves
    throughput at the cost of an increase in binary size.
    The am335x-mlo configuration is very size constrained, because it
    needs to fit into on-chip SRAM to be able to set up DRAM and thus
    we use the smaller C implementation instead.
  variants:
    - condition: |
        kconfig.have_barebox_config() and
        kconfig.BareboxConfig()['ARCH_OMAP'] and kconfig.BareboxConfig()['SHELL_NONE']
      value: False
    - value: True

barebox_gpt_support:
  description: |
    The am335x boot ROM expects SD/MMC media to be formatted as MBR
    and loads the first stage bootloader from the BOOT.BIN file from the
    first vfat partition. As the MLO

    As the am335x-mlo configuration's only function is to chainload
    barebox, we only need GPT support later on in the regular second stage
    barebox configuration.
  variants:
    - condition: |
        kconfig.have_barebox_config() and
        kconfig.BareboxConfig()['ARCH_OMAP'] and kconfig.BareboxConfig()['SHELL_NONE']
      value: False
    - value: True

rootfs_unused_libraries:
  description: |
    - libatomic is needed on mips and rpi1 by libcrypto, but for simplicity ship it on all platforms
  optional:
  - !!re '/usr/lib/libatomic\.so.*'

optee_security_warning_disabled:
  description: |
    OP-TEE is used as secure monitor on STM32MP13x providing power
    management and clock/reset control support. We don't use it as
    part of a trusted boot setup, so it's apt for OP-TEE to warn
    about this at startup and thus we'll keep CFG_INSECURE enabled.
